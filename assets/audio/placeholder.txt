This directory contains placeholder files for game audio assets.

In a production environment, you would replace these with actual audio files like:

- background_music.mp3 - Background game music
- unit_spawn.wav - Sound when a unit is spawned
- unit_attack.wav - Sound when units attack each other
- unit_death.wav - Sound when a unit is destroyed
- powerup_activate.wav - Sound when a powerup is activated
- game_over.wav - Sound when the game ends
